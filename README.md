# Asynchronous JavaScript Blog

This project is a simple blog-style webpage created to explain some key concepts in asynchronous JavaScript, including callbacks, promises, async/await, and the event loop. The goal is to learn and provide explanations of these topics along with code examples.

## Project Structure
- **HTML**: The main content of the page is written in HTML, structured using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
- **CSS**: The page is styled using external CSS stylesheets. One for the general layout (`styles.css`) and one for custom fonts (`fonts.css`).
- **Code Examples**: Code blocks are provided for each topic using `<pre><code>` tags with syntax highlighting using custom CSS.
- **Images**: Sample images are included in the header and content area for visual design.

## Topics Covered
1. **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Explains how JavaScript handles asynchronous tasks and why it's essential for web development.
2. **Callback**: Covers the basics of callbacks in JavaScript, including potential issues like "callback hell".
3. **Promise**: Discusses the `Promise` object, its states, and how it improves asynchronous programming.
4. **Async/Await**: Explains the modern `async/await` syntax for working with promises in a more readable way.
5. **Event Loop**: Provides an overview of how the JavaScript event loop works to manage asynchronous tasks.
